# Kata workspace

This repository is setup to run code katas in JS/TS.

Simply create a js/ts file anywhere (deep) inside src/ and you should be able to run them using vscode debugging.

## Features
1. Tests with Vitest
2. Ramda installed (because why not)
3. No bundling as each file is meant to be run individually
4. Launch configuration setup with auto switching between JS and TS based on active file
